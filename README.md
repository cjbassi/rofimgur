# rofimgur

A script that uploads screenshots to imgur anonymously and uses [rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi) to allow you to choose screenshot method.

Can be installed from the AUR with the `rofimgur-git` package.

Requires: `rofi`, `maim`, `curl`, `xclip`, and `xdotool`.

All credit goes to [Astrak](https://git.astrak.co/astrak). Original script found in his dotfiles [here](https://git.astrak.co/astrak/dots/src/branch/master/rofi/.config/rofi/scripts/maim_imgur.sh). I just did some minor changes and created an AUR package for the script.
