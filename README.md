# rofimgur

A script that uploads screenshots to imgur anonymously and uses [rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi) to allow you to choose screenshot method.

Can be installed from the AUR with the `rofimgur-git` package.

All credit goes to reddit user Aza_ze1. I just did some minor changes and created an AUR package for the script.
